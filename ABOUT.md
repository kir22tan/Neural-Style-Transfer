# üé® Neural Style Transfer with VGG-19

This project implements **Neural Style Transfer (NST)** using a pre-trained **VGG-19** Convolutional Neural Network. The goal is to generate a new image that combines the structural **content** of one image with the artistic **style** of another ‚Äî creating visually compelling, stylized artwork.

## üß† What is Neural Style Transfer?

Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning technique that blends the **content of a source image** with the **artistic style of a reference image**.

This is achieved by:
- Extracting high-level **content features** and low-level **style features** using a CNN.
- Optimizing a new image to minimize both content and style loss.

> Originally proposed by Gatys et al. (2015), NST has enabled creative applications from digital art to video stylization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **Input**
- üñºÔ∏è Content image (structure)
- üé® Style image (artistic influence)

### **Feature Extraction**
- Use a **pre-trained VGG-19** to extract hierarchical features.

### **Representations**
- **Content**: Higher-layer activations.
- **Style**: Gram matrices of lower-layer activations.

### **Loss Functions**
- **Content Loss**: Difference between content features.
- **Style Loss**: Difference between Gram matrices.

### **Optimization**
- Initialize with the content image or white noise.
- Use **gradient descent** (L-BFGS or Adam) to minimize total loss.

### **Output**
- A stylized image that preserves content structure and adopts artistic style.
